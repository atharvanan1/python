### String Operations p1

Strings can be enclosed in following ways:  
`'..'`		single quotes
`".."`		double quotes

Use \ to escape quotes.  
Ex. 	`"\'Hello, world\'"` will output as 'Hello, world'  
	`"\"Hello, world\""` will output as "Hello, world"  
	`'\'Hello, world\''` will output as 'Hello, world'  
	`'\"Hello, world\"'` will output as "Hello, world"  
	`''Hello, world''` will output as syntax error  
	`""Hello, world""` will output as syntax error  
	`'"Hello, world"'` will output as "Hello, world"  
	`"'Hello, world'"` will output as 'Hello, world'

`\n` 		new line character  
`r`		raw string Ex. `print(r"\n")` will print \n  
`'''...'''`	multiline output  
'"""..."""`	multiline output  
*		repeat
+		concatenate
'..''..'	side-by-side concatenate, only for literals  

That's all about String Operations p1. Will add more.
